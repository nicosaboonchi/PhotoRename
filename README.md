# Photo Renamer

## How to use
1. Download a csv file from fulcrum making sure the _include photos_ check box is checked.
2. Unzip the folder
3. You can place the folder on your local machine or on a network drive. The reanmer will run much faster on the local machine than a network drive.
4. Open the photo renamer app
5. Click _Select CSV_ this will open up your documents folder. If the fulcrum folder is not in your documents then you will have to navigate to find it. The correct csv file will be the name of the Fulcrum app and not have photo or photos in the name.
6. Verify the CSV you selected is correct.
7. Next click _Select Source Destination_. This will open the same folder that the CSV was. If you did not move any files from the Fulcrum folder the folder that opens is the one with all the photos.
8. Verify the directory where the photos are is correct.
9. Next click _Select Destination Directory_. This is the folder where you want the renamed images to copy to. Make a directory if you do not already have a destination.
10. Verify destination directory.
11. Now click _Rename Photos_. This should only take a few seconds or minutes depending where the photos are being copied to.
12. The app will show a pop up when the photos are completely renamed and close the window.
13. If you need to close out of the app press the X and skip past the reporting problem to windows.
