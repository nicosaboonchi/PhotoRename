# Photo Renamer App

This app helps the Facilities Management team easily rename photos captured using Fulcrum. It renames photos based on their associated barcodes so that each file follows the format `<barcode #> - 1.jpg`, `<barcode #> - 2.jpg`, and so on.

## How to Use

1. **Download the CSV File**  
   From Fulcrum, download the CSV file, ensuring the "Include Photos" checkbox is checked. This will download the photos and 3 CSV files.

2. **Unzip the Folder**  
   Unzip the folder that contains the photos and CSV file.

3. **Local or Network Drive**  
   You can place the folder on your local machine or a network drive. The renamer will run much faster if the folder is stored locally.

4. **Open the Photo Renamer App**

5. **Select CSV File**  
   Click the _Select CSV_ button. This will open your Documents folder by default. If the Fulcrum folder is not located there, navigate to its location.  
   The correct CSV file should have the same name as the Fulcrum app and should *not* include the words "photo" or "photos." The CSV must also contain a column named `barcode` and a `photos` column with the associated photo filenames.

6. **Verify CSV File**  
   Ensure that the correct CSV file is selected.

7. **Select Source Folder**  
   Click _Select Source Destination_ to choose the folder that contains the original photos. This should be the same folder where the CSV file is located, unless you have moved files.

8. **Verify Source Folder**  
   Confirm that the selected folder contains the photos to be renamed.

9. **Select Destination Folder**  
   Click _Select Destination Directory_ to choose where the renamed images will be saved. Create a new directory if necessary.

10. **Verify Destination Folder**  
    Double-check that the destination directory is correct.

11. **Rename Photos**  
    Click _Rename Photos_ to begin the renaming process. Depending on the size and location of the files, this should take only a few seconds to a few minutes.

12. **Completion Notification**  
    A pop-up will notify you when the renaming is complete, after which the window will close automatically.

13. **Close the App**  
    To manually close the app, click the X button. If prompted with a "reporting problem to Windows" message, you can skip it.
