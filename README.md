# **Photo Renamer App**

This app renames photos using information from a CSV file. It simplifies the process of renaming photos based on barcodes and ensures that each image follows the format: `barcode - 1.jpg`, `barcode - 2.jpg`, and so on.

## **Getting Started with Facilities Management** üöÄ

### 1. **Download the CSV File**

- From **Fulcrum**, export the CSV file by checking the "Include Photos" option.
- Ensure the file format is set to **CSV**, and leave the **Date Range** blank. This will export all relevant data.
- Once the export is complete, download the CSV file from Fulcrum.

### 2. **Unzip the Folder**

- Unzip the folder containing the photos and CSV file by right-clicking and selecting **Extract All**. This will expand the contents, including three CSV files and the photos.

### 3. **Choose Storage Location**

- You can place the unzipped folder on your local machine or a network drive.
- For faster performance, store the folder locally.

### 4. **Open the Photo Renamer App**

### 5. **Select the CSV File**

- Click the **Select CSV** button to open a file dialog. The system will default to your **Documents** folder.
- Navigate to the correct folder if needed. The CSV file should have the same name as your Fulcrum app and should not include the words "photo" or "photos."

### 6. **Verify CSV Contents**

- Ensure that the selected CSV contains two key columns:
  - `barcode` (for photo renaming)
  - `photos` (with the original image filenames)

### 7. **Select Source Folder**

- Click **Select Source Destination** to choose the folder containing the original photos. This should match the folder where the CSV is located unless you've moved the files.

### 8. **Verify Source Folder**

- Double-check that the selected folder contains the photos you want to rename.

### 9. **Select Destination Folder**

- Click **Select Destination Directory** to choose where the renamed photos will be saved.
- If necessary, create a new folder for the renamed files.

### 10. **Confirm Destination Folder**

- Ensure the correct destination folder is selected.

### 11. **Rename Photos**

- Click **Rename Photos** to start the renaming process.
- The progress bar will update every 25 photos, giving you an indication of the process speed.
- Depending on the file count and source location, the renaming may take anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes.

### 12. **Completion Notification**

- Once the renaming process is complete, a pop-up will inform you of the operation's success. It will display the total time taken and any errors encountered.
- If errors occur, an `errorslog.txt` file will be generated in the **source directory**.
- Press **OK** to automatically close the app.

### 13. **Close the App**

- To manually close the app, click the **X** button.
- If a "reporting problem to Windows" prompt appears, feel free to skip it.

# üöÄ Getting Started with EAS

### 1. Export CSV from Access

1. Open the Access database that contains your photos.
2. In the left sidebar, **right-click** the `PhotoRename-Assets` query.
3. Select **Export** ‚Üí **Text File**.
4. Choose a location and save the file.

### 2. Prepare the CSV

1. Change the file extension from `.txt` to `.csv`.  
   **Example:** `PhotoRename-Assets.txt` ‚Üí `PhotoRename-Assets.csv`

   > üìå _The file name doesn't matter, but the extension must be `.csv`._

2. Open the exported file and follow these settings:

   - Set **Delimited** to ON
   - Select **Comma** as the delimiter
   - Check **Include Field Names on First Row**

3. Click **Next**, then **Finish**.

### 3. Open the Rename Tool

- If you don‚Äôt have the tool yet, download the `Rename.exe` file from [**Insert Download Link Here**].
- Save the file to your Desktop for quick access.

### 4. Navigate to the EAS Tab

- Open the app and switch to the **EAS** tab.

### 5. Select Your CSV File

- Click the **Select CSV** button.
- The file dialog will open in your Documents folder by default.
- Navigate to where you saved the `.csv` file.
  > üìå _Only `.csv` files will appear in the file dialog._

### 6. Select the Source Folder

- Click **Select Source Destination**.
- Choose the folder containing the **original photos**.
  > üí° _This is typically located in your Fulcrum folder._

### 7. Select the Destination Folder

- Click **Select Destination Directory**.
- Choose or create a folder where the renamed photos will be saved.
  > ‚ö†Ô∏è _Using a local directory (e.g., Desktop or C:\) is generally faster than using a network drive._

## **Common Errors & How to Fix Them** üòí

- **Missing `photos` or `barcode` column**:

  The CSV file is missing one or both of the required columns. Ensure you‚Äôve selected the correct CSV file.

- **Missing `org_name`, `new_name`, `folder`**:

  The CSV file is missing one or all of the required columns. Ensure that the csv contains the correct headers.

- **Photo name already exists**:

  A photo with the same name already exists in the destination folder. **This can be a big problem** since that can imply two different assets have the same barcode number.

- **Image not found in source directory**:

  The script couldn't locate the original photo in the source folder. This may occur if a photo was deleted, moved, or never existed for the asset in question.

- **Error copying image**:

  A script issue prevented the image from being copied. Try rerunning the app.

- **Error reading CSV file**:

  If the CSV file is corrupt or incorrectly formatted, an error will display with further details.
